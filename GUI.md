**About GUI**
This GUI was created for a more user-friendly interface. Given the fact that the heart of this project is about the backend coding, the GUI was created via a generator.
I still wanted to include the GUI so that it can allow other users to visualize the work that the original backend code is doing in a more realistic example, rather than a terminal. 
Please keep in mind that this GUI was not created by myself, but rather through the use of a template, it's sole purpose is to display the code found in the main.py
