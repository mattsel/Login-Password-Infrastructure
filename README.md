# Login-Password-Infrastructure
Overview:
In this project I am implementing a basic infrastructure for a password creation screen. This will include a prompt that will ask for a users email and password. When a user enters a password, the program will run a series of tests to decide if the password is strong enough. Those tests include: Character Length, Utilization of Special Characters, and Capital letters. An additional test that will be implemented on the user's password is to test the similarity to an email address. Often times a users password is similar to their email address. So in order to prevent an easily guessed password, this test will test the similairty, and after a certain threshold, the prompt will ask the user to use a more unique password. The overall goal of this project is to create a program that will prompt a user to enter a password, and ensure that the password that is provided is secure enough for the customers needs.
